The data fields of the tidy datset created by the script runaanalysis are discussed in this document. The tidy dataset file name is summary.volunteer.actitvity and is the final result of processing a
script named runanalysis.r For each, appropriate path names should be appended to the beginning of the file name. The tidy set is dimensioned as 180 x 68. 

Identifiers

subject - identifies one of thirty participants, numbered consecutively, 1-30.
activity - identifies one of six activities, numbered 1-6, consecutively.

Activity measurements with mean or std in name were retained from original 561 measurement vector. 
Names for tho nmeasurement variables were re-cast to make for easier reading by eliminating '-()'
embedded within them. This link from the University of California data repository http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/UCI%20HAR%20Dataset.names provides additional information about these measurements. 66 measurement variables are retained from a starting set of 561.
